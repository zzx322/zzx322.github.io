I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of CS](https://cs.hainanu.edu.cn/), [Hainan University](https://www.hainanu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Tensor Analysis, machine learning, and Computer Vision.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaokang Wang](https://cs.hainanu.edu.cn/info/1104/2323.htm) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.hainanu.edu.cn/), Hainan University.
